# FOR HACK-A-BIT HACKATHON 2018 

## News Aggregator That Helps Mitigate Effect of Media Bias on Users.

<b>6th highest ranked hack at HACK-A-BIT 2018. I was part of the only single-memeber team selected for HACK-A-BIT 2018. </b> 

## Description
For HACK-A-BIT Hackathon 2018, I created a News Aggregator that uses Machine Learning model to check news articles for biased content. It furthur, utilises sentiment analysis to understand the type of bias - 'positive' or 'negative'. Any news search made through the app, returns news articles along with their classification, and if a certain news article is biased, the app provides the user, a link to another news article providing a different perspective. The app also offers functionality to analyse news article by URL.
